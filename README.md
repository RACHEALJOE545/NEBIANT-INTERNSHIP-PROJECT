## Introduction:

This project develops a Predictive Lead Scoring Model to evaluate and rank leads based on their conversion potential. By leveraging data-driven insights, the goal is to help the sales team focus on high-priority leads, optimize resources, and improve conversion rates. 

Leads were categorized into High, Medium, and Low likelihood groups to enhance prioritization and support business growth.

### Problem Statement:

Businesses often struggle with identifying which leads are most likely to convert, leading to wasted effort and low efficiency in sales processes. The challenge was to design a model that predicts lead conversion probabilities and provides actionable insights to guide sales strategies.

## Key Metrics:

- Conversion Likelihood (High / Medium / Low)

- Model Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

- Sentiment-based scoring of leadsâ€™ text responses

- Feature importance (using SHAP values)

- Lead source performance (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Referrals)

## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- Python for Data Science: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

- Data Preprocessing: handling missing values, outliers, duplicates

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): trend exploration and visualization

- Feature Engineering:

-- Encoding categorical variables

-- Creating time-based and sentiment features

-- TF-IDF vectorization for text data

-- K-Means clustering for grouping similar text

- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

- Model Optimization: GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV

- Model Explainability: SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)

- Visualization: data distributions, feature importance, lead conversion trends

## Analysis Summary: 

The visualizations highlight patterns in lead sources, demographic trends, sentiment analysis, and conversion likelihoods. They also demonstrate how certain features (like engagement, sentiment score, and source) strongly influence conversion probability.

## Conclusion:

- The predictive lead scoring model effectively classifies leads into High, Medium, and Low categories.

- Sentiment analysis and lead source are key drivers of conversion.

- Conversion rates can be improved by focusing on promising sources (like Facebook) and positive sentiment leads.

## Recommendations:

- Optimize Lead Manager Performance: Track and evaluate engagement using CRM tools.

- Enhance Follow-up Strategies: Automate timely and personalized follow-ups.

- Prioritize High-Converting Segments: Increase marketing spend on effective lead sources.

- Geographic Customization: Tailor campaigns to regions like Nigeria, South Africa, and the UK.

- Gender Inclusivity: Promote programs to underrepresented groups.

- Continuous Model Updates: Refine the predictive model as new data arrives.
